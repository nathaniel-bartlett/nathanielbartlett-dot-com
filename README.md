* One-page design
### MAIN COMPONENTS
#### Dog Ear Navigation Menu Button
* Takes up very little space (top left corner)
* The 45 degree angle is a nice contrast to all the horizonal and vertical elements
* 80% opacity to reduce visual footprint, especially on small mobile devices
* Entire triangular area is active, not just the menu bars, giving a big target for mouse pointer and fingers
#### Side-Toggle text Boxes
* Once opened, the text boxes have a toggle strip on the right side so you can close the box at any time. There is no need to scroll back to the top, which is a huge hassle for very tall boxes.
* If you have scrolled down so the top of the box is aboce the top of the screen, chicking the toggle bar will colapse the box *and* bring the top of the text box right to where you clicked.
#### Title Page
* SVG Background image scales to page size, either 100% vertical or horiziontal
